# TABLE 4.5.2 Proportions of Unmarried Male-Female Couples Sharing a Household in the United States, 1991
|                  | Female                                           |       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Male**         | **Never married** | **Divorced** | **Widowed** | **Married to other** | **Total** |
| Never married    | .401              | .111         | .017        | .025               | .554    |
| Divorced         | .117              | .195         | .024        | .017               | .353    |
| Widowed          | .006              | .008         | .016        | .001               | .031    |

| **Total**        | .545              | .336         | .060        | .059               | 1.000   |

## Explanation
This table shows the proportions of unmarried couples living together in the United States in 1991, categorized by their marital status. The table is organized as a cross-tabulation with:
- Rows representing the male partner's marital status: never married, divorced, widowed, or married to someone else
- Columns representing the female partner's marital status using the same categories
- Each cell containing the proportion of all unmarried cohabiting couples that fall into that specific combination
For example:
- The largest proportion (.401 or 40.1%) represents couples where both partners have never been married
- 19.5% of couples consist of both partners being divorced
- Only 1.6% of couples have both partners being widowed
- 1.6% of couples have both partners being married to other people
The row and column totals show the overall distributions by gender. For instance, 55.4% of males in these arrangements have never been married, while 54.5% of females have never been married.
This data provides insight into the relationship history and legal marital status of unmarried couples who were sharing households in the early 1990s.

## Problem 1
A house needs to be reroofed in the spring. To do this a dry, windless day is needed. The probability of getting a dry day is 0.7, a windy day is 0.4, and a wet and windy day is 0.2. What is the probability of getting:
(a) a wet day?
$$P(W) = 1 - P(D) = .3$$
(b) a day that is either wet, windy, or both?
$$ P(wet \cup windy) = P(wet) + P(windy) - P(wet \cap windy)$$
$$ .3 + .4 - .2 = \textbf{.5} $$
(c) a day when the house can be reroofed?
$$ = P(dry \cap windless) $$
$$ = P(dry)*P(windless) $$ **assuming they are independent**
$$ = .7 * .6 = \textbf{.42} $$

## Problem 2
Using the data in Table 4.5.2, what is the probability that for a randomly chosen unmarried couple:
(a) the male is divorced or married to someone else?
$$ P(M_D \cup M_{MO}) = P(M_D) + P(M_{MO}) $$
$$ = .353 + .062 = \textbf{.415} $$

(b) both the male and the female are either divorced or married to someone else?
$$ P((M_D \cup M_{MO}) \cap (F_D \cup F_{MO})) $$
$$ = P((M_D \cup M_{MO}) \text{ and } (F_D \cup F_{MO})) $$
$$ = .195 + .017 + .024 + .017 + .008 + .001 + .022 + .003 + .016 = \textbf{.303} $$

(c) neither is married to anyone else? Such a collection of events is technically known as a partition of $S$.
$$ P(\text{neither married to others}) = P(\text{not } M_{MO} \text{ and not } F_{MO}) $$
$$ = 1 - P(M_{MO} \cup F_{MO}) $$
$$ = 1 - (.062 + .059 - .016) $$
$$ = 1 - .105 = \textbf{.895} $$

(d) at least one is married to someone else?
$$ P(M_{MO} \cup F_{MO}) = P(M_{MO}) + P(F_{MO}) - P(M_{MO} \cap F_{MO}) $$
$$ = .062 + .059 - .016 = \textbf{.105} $$

(e) the male is married to someone else or the female is divorced or both?
$$ P(M_{MO} \cup F_D) = P(M_{MO}) + P(F_D) - P(M_{MO} \cap F_D) $$
$$ = .062 + .336 - .022 = \textbf{.376} $$

(f) the female is divorced and the male is not divorced?
$$ P(F_D \cap \text{not } M_D \cap \text{not } M_{MO}) = P(F_D \cap M_{NM} \cap M_W) $$
$$ = .111 + .017 = \textbf{.128} $$

# Quiz on Section 4.5

## Question 1
**If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, what is the probability that both occur? What is the probability that at least one occurs?**

For mutually exclusive events $A$ and $B$:

**Probability that both occur:**
$P(A \cap B) = 0$

This is because mutually exclusive events cannot occur simultaneously by definition.

**Probability that at least one occurs:**
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

Since the events are mutually exclusive, there is no overlap to subtract.

## Question 2
**If we have two or more mutually exclusive events, how do we find the probability that at least one of them occurs?**

For mutually exclusive events $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$:

$P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + ... + P(A_n)$

We simply add the individual probabilities since there is no overlap between mutually exclusive events.

## Question 3
**Why is it sometimes easier to compute $P(A)$ from $1 - P(A^c)$?**

Computing $P(A)$ from $1 - P(A^c)$ (where $A^c$ is the complement of $A$) is often easier when:

1. The event $A$ is complex with many possible outcomes
2. The complement $A^c$ has fewer outcomes or a simpler structure
3. $A$ can be defined as "at least one" of several events (making $A^c$ "none of them")

This approach leverages the complement rule: $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$, which can simplify calculations significantly when $A^c$ is more straightforward to analyze than $A$ directly.
